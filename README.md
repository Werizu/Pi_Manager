# PiManager

A command-line tool for managing one or more Raspberry Pis from macOS. Deploy websites, monitor system health, restart services, view logs, and SSH into your Pis — all from a single `pi` command with an interactive REPL.

## Features

- **Multi-Pi support** — manage multiple Raspberry Pis from one tool, switch between them with `use <name>`
- **Interactive REPL** — type `pi` and stay in a persistent shell with tab-completion and command history
- **One-shot CLI** — run `pi status` or `pi deploy my-site` directly from your terminal for scripting
- **System monitoring** — CPU, RAM, disk, temperature, uptime at a glance
- **Service management** — check status, restart individual services or all at once
- **Log viewing** — tail Apache error logs, with optional real-time streaming
- **One-command deploys** — rsync to Pi, restart Apache, purge Cloudflare cache
- **SSH** — opens in a new Terminal.app window so the REPL stays running
- **Setup wizard** — generates SSH keys, copies them to the Pi, tests the connection
- **Backwards-compatible** — old single-Pi configs are automatically migrated

## Requirements

- macOS (uses Terminal.app for SSH windows)
- Python 3.10+
- [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (recommended) or pip
- One or more Raspberry Pis with SSH enabled

## Installation

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
brew install pipx

# Clone the repo (use SSH if you have it set up)
git clone https://github.com/Werizu/Pi-WebHost-Manager.git
cd Pi-WebHost-Manager

# Install
pipx install .
```

The `pi` command is now available globally in your terminal.

## Quick start

```bash
pi
```

On first run a setup wizard walks you through:

1. Pi name (e.g. `homepi`, `mediaserver`)
2. IP address / hostname and username
3. SSH key generation (stored safely in `~/.pi-manager/keys/`, not in the project directory)
4. Copying the public key to your Pi
5. Which services to monitor (defaults: `apache2`, `mariadb`, `cloudflared`)
6. Option to add more Pis
7. Cloudflare setup — same account for all Pis or separate tokens per Pi
8. Deploy projects (local path, remote path, target Pi, Cloudflare zone ID per project)

The wizard tests the SSH connection for each Pi and tells you if something's wrong. Re-run anytime with `setup` (REPL) or `pi setup` (CLI).

## Usage

### Interactive mode (REPL)

Run `pi` with no arguments to enter the interactive shell:

```
$ pi
  PiManager  v0.1.1
  2 Pis: homepi(192.168.1.100) · mediaserver(192.168.1.101)

  Type help for commands, exit to quit
─────────────────────────────────────

pi > status              # shows all Pis
pi > status --pi homepi  # just one Pi
pi > use mediaserver     # switch active Pi
pi > status              # now shows mediaserver only
pi > deploy my-site
pi > list-pis
pi > add-pi              # add another Pi
pi > exit
```

Features:
- **Tab completion** for all commands
- **Command history** persisted in `~/.pi-manager/history` (arrow keys to navigate)
- **Styled prompt** powered by prompt\_toolkit

### One-shot mode (CLI)

Pass a command directly for scripting or quick use:

```bash
pi status                    # all Pis
pi status --pi homepi        # specific Pi
pi deploy my-site            # uses Pi from project config
pi deploy my-site --pi mediaserver  # override target Pi
pi services --pi homepi
pi list-pis
pi add-pi
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `status` | Show system status for all Pis (or `--pi <name>` for one) |
| `services` | Show service status for all Pis (or `--pi <name>` for one) |
| `logs` | Show last 30 lines of Apache error log |
| `logs -n 100` | Show more lines |
| `logs --live` | Stream logs in real-time (Ctrl+C to stop) |
| `restart <service>` | Restart a single service |
| `restart all` | Restart all monitored services |
| `ssh` | Open SSH in a new Terminal.app window |
| `deploy <name>` | Rsync project to Pi + restart Apache + purge Cloudflare cache |
| `list-pis` | List all configured Pis |
| `add-pi` | Add a new Pi interactively |
| `remove-pi <name>` | Remove a Pi |
| `use <pi-name>` | Set active Pi for the REPL session |
| `config` | Show current configuration |
| `add-project` | Add a new deploy project interactively (browses remote folders) |
| `list-projects` | List all configured projects |
| `remove-project <name>` | Remove a project |
| `setup` | Re-run the setup wizard |
| `shutdown` | Shut down the active Pi (asks for confirmation) |
| `reboot` | Reboot the active Pi (asks for confirmation) |
| `uninstall` | Remove config and uninstall PiManager |
| `help` | Show all available commands |
| `exit` / `quit` | Exit the REPL |

All commands that target a specific Pi accept `--pi <name>`. Without it:
- `status` and `services` show **all Pis**
- Other commands use the **active Pi** (set via `use`) or the **default Pi**

## Configuration

All config and keys are stored in `~/.pi-manager/`:

```
~/.pi-manager/
├── config.json     # Main configuration
├── keys/           # SSH keys (generated during setup)
│   ├── id_rsa
│   └── id_rsa.pub
└── history         # REPL command history
```

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "pis": {
    "homepi": {
      "host": "192.168.1.100",
      "user": "pi",
      "ssh_key_path": "~/.pi-manager/keys/id_rsa",
      "services": ["apache2", "mariadb", "cloudflared"]
    },
    "mediaserver": {
      "host": "192.168.1.101",
      "user": "pi",
      "ssh_key_path": "~/.pi-manager/keys/id_rsa",
      "services": ["plex", "samba"],
      "cloudflare_api_token": "separate-token-if-different-account"
    }
  },
  "default_pi": "homepi",
  "cloudflare_api_token": "global-token-for-all-pis",
  "projects": {
    "my-site": {
      "local_path": "/Users/you/Sites/my-site/",
      "remote_path": "/var/www/my-site/",
      "pi": "homepi",
      "cloudflare_zone_id": "zone-id-for-my-site"
    },
    "blog": {
      "local_path": "/Users/you/Sites/blog/",
      "remote_path": "/var/www/blog/",
      "pi": "homepi",
      "cloudflare_zone_id": "different-zone-id-for-blog"
    }
  }
}
```

- **`cloudflare_api_token`** (global) — used for all Pis by default
- **`cloudflare_api_token`** (per-Pi, optional) — overrides the global token if a Pi uses a different Cloudflare account
- **`cloudflare_zone_id`** — always per project, since one Pi can host multiple sites with different zones

**Migration:** If you're upgrading from v0.1.0, your old single-Pi config is automatically migrated to the new format on first load. No manual changes needed.

You can edit the file directly or use `pi setup` / `pi add-project` / `pi add-pi`.

## Deploy workflow

When you run `deploy <name>`, PiManager:

1. **Resolves the target Pi** — from `--pi` flag, project config, active Pi, or default
2. **Rsyncs** the local project folder to the Pi (excludes `.git`, `.DS_Store`, `node_modules`)
3. **Restarts Apache** on the Pi
4. **Purges Cloudflare cache** (if a zone ID and API token are configured)

## FAQ

**Where is the config stored?**
`~/.pi-manager/config.json`. Edit it directly or use `pi setup` / `pi add-project`.

**Where are the SSH keys stored?**
In `~/.pi-manager/keys/`. This keeps them out of any project directory so they can't accidentally be committed to git.

**Can I manage multiple Pis?**
Yes. Run `pi add-pi` to add more Pis at any time, or add them during `pi setup`. Use `pi list-pis` to see all configured Pis. In the REPL, `use <name>` switches the active Pi for the session.

**How does Pi resolution work for commands?**
1. Explicit `--pi <name>` always wins
2. For `deploy`: falls back to the project's configured `pi` field
3. In the REPL: falls back to the active Pi set via `use`
4. Finally falls back to `default_pi` from the config

**I upgraded from v0.1.0 — do I need to change my config?**
No. PiManager automatically migrates old configs to the new multi-Pi format. Your existing Pi becomes `pi` (the default name).

**How do I change my SSH key path?**
Run `pi setup` to reconfigure, or edit `ssh_key_path` in the config file.

**How do I get a Cloudflare API token?**
Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) and create a token with **Zone > Cache Purge > Purge** permission. Add it during setup or edit the config file.

**Can I deploy multiple websites?**
Yes. Run `add-project` for each site (assign each to a Pi), then `deploy <name>` to deploy individually.

**How do I monitor custom services?**
Enter your services as a comma-separated list during setup, or edit the `services` array per Pi in the config file.

**SSH opens in a new window — can I use the current terminal instead?**
In one-shot mode (`pi ssh`) SSH also opens in a new Terminal.app window. This is by design so the REPL stays usable. For an inline session, run `ssh -i ~/.pi-manager/keys/id_rsa pi@your-pi-ip` directly.

**Connection issues?**
- *"Can't reach the Pi"* — check that the Pi is powered on and the IP is correct
- *"SSH key rejected"* — run `pi setup` to regenerate and recopy the key
- *"Connection timed out"* — verify your network connection

## Updating

```bash
cd Pi_Manager
git pull
pipx install . --force
```

## Uninstalling

From the REPL:
```
pi > uninstall
```

Or manually:
```bash
pipx uninstall pi-manager
rm -rf ~/.pi-manager
```
