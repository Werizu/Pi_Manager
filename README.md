# PiManager

A command-line tool for managing one or more Raspberry Pis from macOS. Deploy websites, monitor system health, restart services, view logs, and SSH into your Pis — all from a single `pi` command with an interactive REPL.

## Features

- **Multi-Pi support** — manage multiple Raspberry Pis from one tool, switch between them with `use`
- **Tailscale support** — automatically connects via LAN at home or Tailscale VPN when away
- **Numbered selection** — pick Pis, projects, and services by number instead of typing names
- **Interactive REPL** — type `pi` and stay in a persistent shell with tab-completion and command history
- **One-shot CLI** — run `pi status` or `pi deploy my-site` directly from your terminal for scripting
- **Self-updating** — run `pi update` to pull the latest version and reinstall
- **System monitoring** — CPU, RAM, disk, temperature, uptime at a glance
- **Service management** — check status, start, stop, or restart individual services or all at once
- **One-command upgrade** — run `pi upgrade-pis` to update all packages on every Pi and restart their services
- **Log viewing** — tail Apache error logs, with optional real-time streaming
- **One-command deploys** — rsync to Pi, restart Apache, purge Cloudflare cache
- **SSH** — opens in a new Terminal.app window so the REPL stays running
- **Setup wizard** — generates SSH keys, copies them to the Pi, tests the connection
- **Backwards-compatible** — old single-Pi configs are automatically migrated

## Requirements

- macOS (uses Terminal.app for SSH windows)
- Python 3.10+
- [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (recommended) or pip
- One or more Raspberry Pis with SSH enabled

## Installation

```bash
# Install pipx if you don't have it
brew install pipx

# Clone the repo (use SSH if you have it set up)
git clone https://github.com/Werizu/Pi-WebHost-Manager.git
cd Pi-WebHost-Manager

# Install
pipx install .
```

The `pi` command is now available globally in your terminal.

## Quick start

```bash
pi
```

On first run a setup wizard walks you through:

1. Pi name (e.g. `homepi`, `mediaserver`)
2. IP address / hostname and username
3. SSH key generation (stored safely in `~/.pi-manager/keys/`, not in the project directory)
4. Copying the public key to your Pi
5. Which services to monitor (defaults: `apache2`, `mariadb`, `cloudflared`)
6. Tailscale IP (optional — for remote access via VPN)
7. Option to add more Pis
8. Cloudflare setup — same account for all Pis or separate tokens per Pi
9. Deploy projects (local path, remote path, target Pi, Cloudflare zone ID per project)

The wizard tests the SSH connection for each Pi and tells you if something's wrong. Re-run anytime with `setup` (REPL) or `pi setup` (CLI).

## Usage

### Interactive mode (REPL)

Run `pi` with no arguments to enter the interactive shell:

```
$ pi
  PiManager  v0.3.3
  2 Pis: homepi(192.168.1.100) · mediaserver(192.168.1.101)

  Type help for commands, exit to quit
─────────────────────────────────────

pi > use                 # numbered Pi selection:
                         #   1) homepi (192.168.1.100)
                         #   2) mediaserver (192.168.1.101)
                         #   0) Cancel
                         # > 2
pi > status              # shows all Pis
pi > deploy              # numbered project selection
pi > restart             # numbered service selection
pi > status --pi homepi  # explicit Pi via flag
pi > list-pis
pi > update              # self-update from git
pi > exit
```

Features:
- **Tab completion** for all commands
- **Command history** persisted in `~/.pi-manager/history` (arrow keys to navigate)
- **Styled prompt** powered by prompt\_toolkit

### One-shot mode (CLI)

Pass a command directly for scripting or quick use:

```bash
pi status                    # all Pis
pi status --pi homepi        # specific Pi
pi deploy my-site            # uses Pi from project config
pi deploy my-site --pi mediaserver  # override target Pi
pi services --pi homepi
pi restart                   # numbered service selection
pi restart apache2           # restart a specific service
pi stop                      # numbered service selection
pi stop apache2 --pi homepi  # stop a service
pi start                     # numbered service selection
pi start apache2             # start a service
pi deploy                    # numbered project selection
pi ping                      # check all Pis reachable
pi ping --pi homepi          # check specific Pi
pi rename-pi homepi mainpi   # rename a Pi everywhere
pi edit-pi                   # edit host/user/key interactively
pi add-service nginx         # add to active Pi's service list
pi remove-service             # numbered selection to remove
pi open my-site              # open project URL in browser
pi cache-clear my-site       # purge Cloudflare cache only
pi tailscale list            # show LAN/Tailscale IPs and connection mode
pi tailscale set homepi 100.64.0.1  # set Tailscale IP for a Pi
pi tailscale remove homepi   # remove Tailscale IP
pi upgrade-pis               # upgrade packages on all Pis + restart services
pi upgrade-pis --pi homepi   # upgrade a specific Pi only
pi update                    # self-update from git
pi list-pis
pi add-pi
```

- Other commands use the **active Pi** (set via `use`) or the **default Pi**

## Configuration

All config and keys are stored in `~/.pi-manager/`:

```
~/.pi-manager/
├── config.json     # Main configuration
├── keys/           # SSH keys (generated during setup)
│   ├── id_rsa
│   └── id_rsa.pub
└── history         # REPL command history
```

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "pis": {
    "homepi": {
      "host": "192.168.1.100",
      "user": "pi",
      "ssh_key_path": "~/.pi-manager/keys/id_rsa",
      "services": ["apache2", "mariadb", "cloudflared"],
      "tailscale_host": "100.64.0.1"
    },
    "mediaserver": {
      "host": "192.168.1.101",
      "user": "pi",
      "ssh_key_path": "~/.pi-manager/keys/id_rsa",
      "services": ["plex", "samba"],
      "cloudflare_api_token": "separate-token-if-different-account",
      "tailscale_host": "100.64.0.2"
    }
  },
  "default_pi": "homepi",
  "cloudflare_api_token": "global-token-for-all-pis",
  "projects": {
    "my-site": {
      "local_path": "/Users/you/Sites/my-site/",
      "remote_path": "/var/www/my-site/",
      "pi": "homepi",
      "cloudflare_zone_id": "zone-id-for-my-site",
      "url": "https://my-site.example.com"
    },
    "blog": {
      "local_path": "/Users/you/Sites/blog/",
      "remote_path": "/var/www/blog/",
      "pi": "homepi",
      "cloudflare_zone_id": "different-zone-id-for-blog",
      "url": "https://blog.example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

- **`cloudflare_api_token`** (global) — used for all Pis by default
- **`cloudflare_api_token`** (per-Pi, optional) — overrides the global token if a Pi uses a different Cloudflare account
- **`cloudflare_zone_id`** — always per project, since one Pi can host multiple sites with different zones
- **`tailscale_host`** (per-Pi, optional) — Tailscale IP for remote access when not on the home network
- **`url`** (per-project, optional) — website URL used by the `open` command to launch in your browser

**Migration:** If you're upgrading from v0.1.0, your old single-Pi config is automatically migrated to the new format on first load. No manual changes needed.

You can edit the file directly or use `pi setup` / `pi add-project` / `pi add-pi`.

## Deploy workflow

When you run `deploy <name>`, PiManager:

1. **Resolves the target Pi** — from `--pi` flag, project config, active Pi, or default
2. **Rsyncs** the local project folder to the Pi (excludes `.git`, `.DS_Store`, `node_modules`)
3. **Restarts Apache** on the Pi
4. **Purges Cloudflare cache** (if a zone ID and API token are configured)

## FAQ

**Where is the config stored?**
`~/.pi-manager/config.json`. Edit it directly or use `pi setup` / `pi add-project`.

**Where are the SSH keys stored?**
In `~/.pi-manager/keys/`. This keeps them out of any project directory so they can't accidentally be committed to git.

**Can I manage multiple Pis?**
Yes. Run `pi add-pi` to add more Pis at any time, or add them during `pi setup`. Use `pi list-pis` to see all configured Pis. `use <name>` switches the active Pi and persists it as the default so it survives restarts.

**How does Pi resolution work for commands?**
1. Explicit `--pi <name>` always wins
2. For `deploy`: falls back to the project's configured `pi` field
3. In the REPL: falls back to the active Pi set via `use`
4. Finally falls back to `default_pi` from the config

**I upgraded from v0.1.0 — do I need to change my config?**
No. PiManager automatically migrates old configs to the new multi-Pi format. Your existing Pi becomes `pi` (the default name).

**How do I change my SSH key path?**
Run `pi edit-pi` to change host, user, or SSH key path interactively. Or run `pi setup` to reconfigure from scratch, or edit the config file directly.

**How do I get a Cloudflare API token?**
Go to the [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens) and create a token with **Zone > Cache Purge > Purge** permission. Add it during setup or edit the config file.

**Can I deploy multiple websites?**
Yes. Run `add-project` for each site (assign each to a Pi), then `deploy <name>` to deploy individually.

**How do I monitor custom services?**
Enter your services as a comma-separated list during setup, use `pi add-service <name>` / `pi remove-service` to manage them at any time, or edit the `services` array per Pi in the config file.

**How does `open` know the URL for a project?**
Add a `url` field to the project in `~/.pi-manager/config.json`, e.g. `"url": "https://my-site.example.com"`. The `open` command uses macOS `open` to launch it in your default browser.

**Can I clear the Cloudflare cache without deploying?**
Yes. Run `pi cache-clear <project>` (or just `pi cache-clear` for a numbered selection). This reuses the same Cloudflare purge logic as `deploy` but skips rsync and Apache restart.

**SSH opens in a new window — can I use the current terminal instead?**
In one-shot mode (`pi ssh`) SSH also opens in a new Terminal.app window. This is by design so the REPL stays usable. For an inline session, run `ssh -i ~/.pi-manager/keys/id_rsa pi@your-pi-ip` directly.

**How does Tailscale support work?**
PiManager automatically detects whether you're on your home network (192.168.178.x / Fritz!Box) or not. At home, it connects via the Pi's LAN IP. Away from home, it uses the Tailscale IP if configured. Each operation shows the connection method once (e.g. `-> LAN (192.168.178.201)` or `-> Tailscale (100.64.0.1)`). Set Tailscale IPs during setup, via `pi edit-pi`, or with `pi tailscale set <pi> <ip>`.

**Connection issues?**
- *"Can't reach the Pi"* — check that the Pi is powered on and the IP is correct
- *"SSH key rejected"* — run `pi setup` to regenerate and recopy the key
- *"Connection timed out"* — verify your network connection

## Updating

The easiest way to update:

```bash
pi update
```

This pulls the latest changes from git, reinstalls via pipx, and shows a changelog. Your config and SSH keys in `~/.pi-manager/` are never touched.

On first run, `update` asks for the path to your local git clone and remembers it.

Manual update (same thing, just by hand):

```bash
cd Pi_Manager
git pull
pipx install . --force
```

## Uninstalling

From the REPL:
```
pi > uninstall
```

Or manually:
```bash
pipx uninstall pi-manager
rm -rf ~/.pi-manager
```
